# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
Robin wants to create a web page that enables her to scape the internet and gather data and images on Mars.
I was asked to help develop the tool using a web scraper, flask, and save the data into a mongo database.
## Results
At first the web scraper worked perfectly until the challenge. Now, the web scraper only brings in the original data but does not pull in the four images, no matter how much I refactor the code. I am unsure if this issue is tied to my Chrome browser or not. Will test out the bugs more to see what the issue is.
